# 🧬 DNA Sequence Analyzer & Mutation Detector:

This isn't just a simple DNA reader - it's a Comprehensive analysis toolkit that:

-- Handles multiple DNA sequences simultaneously
-- Creates publication-quality visualizations
-- Performs advanced statistical analysis
-- Generates detailed scientific reports
-- Uses professional bioinformatics standards
-- Provides both raw data and visual insights.

# Perfect for researchers,students, and anyone wanting to understand DNA data at a professional level!

## 📌 Overview

This Python-based project reads DNA sequences from FASTA files and analyzes them for:

- GC content : Percentage of C and G bases , If percentage of the GC Content is high then the DNA is More Stable and If the percentage of the GC Content is low then the DNA is very less Stable. Usually 40-60% in most Organisms.
- Transcription (DNA → mRNA) : Conveerting DNA to RNA (first step in making protiens).
- Reverse Complement : The Matching DNA strand (A to T , C to G swapped).
- Point mutations between sequences : Single Letter changes (A to T), Essential for evolution and genetic disorders research.

It simulates part of a genomics pipeline used in research labs, medical diagnostics, and evolutionary biology.
